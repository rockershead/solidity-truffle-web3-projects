A potential tenant would like to lease an apartment using a smart contract. 
The landlord agrees to give the tenant the door code to the apartment as soon as the tenant pays the security deposit. 
Both the tenant and the landlord would send their respective portions of the deal to the smart contract, which would hold onto and automatically exchange the door code 
for the security deposit on the date the lease begins. If the landlord doesnâ€™t supply the door code by the lease date, the smart contract refunds the security deposit. 
This would eliminate the fees and processes typically associated with the use of a notary, third-party mediator, or attornies.
